## Experience

**Project Engineer** Macro Industries, _Mar 2021 – present | Chilliwack, BC_

- Accustomed to a demanding, highly dynamic work environment from on-site role with construction contractor

- Programmatically generated large, detailed site drawings, using self-developed method of AutoCAD automation, saving thousands of man-hours and reducing likelihood of errors

- Pioneered aerial survey program; creating online database of 2D and 3D models using photogrammetry for use in construction planning, drawings, estimating and progress tracking

- Created advanced, map-based visualizations of dynamic project information allowing for all stakeholders to clearly understand performance metrics and project specifications

- Performed complicated analyses of geospatial, project controls, and natural resource data to inform key decisions

**Junior Project Engineer** SA Energy Group, _Jun 2019 – Mar 2021 | Western Canada_

- On-site contract role on large-scale construction projects in Northern BC, Edmonton and Saskatchewan

- Exceptionally strong skills in modelling and visualization, honed through experience incorporating field survey data into engineering drawings such as pipeline profiles, site layouts, grade execution plans

- Worked indepedently and under tight deadlines to perform field survey using RTK GPS and survey drones

- Also worked in Calgary office where exposed to all stages of project estimating; including crew planning, subcontractor relations and resource allocation

**Mechanical Design & Fabrication Lead** Memorial University Baja SAE Team, _Jan 2017 - Jun 2019 | St. John's, NL_

- Built single-seat off-road vehicle alongside a team of students to compete against over 100 other engineering schools in various dynamic events, including a four-hour endurance race

- Devised creative solutions while adhering to strict criteria provided by the Society of Automotive Engineers

- Exhibited strong problem solving ability and practical skills in designing and fabricating major components:
  - New space-frame chassis more ergonomic and 40% lighter than previous version. Performed TIG welding for majority of structure
  - New aluminum sheet metal seat - ergonomics tuned using iterative cardboard prototypes
  - Revised rear suspension trailing links using cutting-edge generative design software - 30% lighter and more manufacturable
