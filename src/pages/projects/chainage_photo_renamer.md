## Background

When working on large-scale linear projects such as pipelines, roads, and power-lines, locations along the project are referred to by their distance to the beginning of the project in meters or 'chainage'.

To measure the chainage of a point given the centerline of the project seems simple enough but can get complicated when considering 'slack chainage'. If two points along the centerline are said to be 100m away from each other it may be less than that when viewed from above. This is because chainage measurements take into account
