description: "Remote control hovercraft built using foamboard, 3D printing, and hobby RC electronics. Designed using Onshape."

Since I was very young I have been fascinated by RC vehicles - especially those that move in an unconventional manner. Hovercrafts are incredibly cool because they don't actually touch the ground, are super fun to drive, and can (theoretically) drive across land as easily as water.

## Tools

I've built many iterations on this simple machine - in several motor configurations and sizes. The earliest models were made using cardboard and insulation foam and sketched on a sheet of graph paper. The most recent models were fully designed in 3D software and built using a mix of foamboard and 3D printing. The 12th and latest model was designed in [Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/en/) - a completely cloud-based CAD software - as the sheet metal feature is much more robust than that of Solidworks.

## Design

This single-fan design channels roughly one-third of the air from the prop through a duct around the perimeter of the craft. This duct is connected to the skirt and has vents directly under the center of the craft. The air fills the skirt and spills out underneath it, creating a cushion of air that the craft can ride on.

## Previous Iterations

Early models were made of cardboard, were much larger, and used a fan for lift and another for thrust.
