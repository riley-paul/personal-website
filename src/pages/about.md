Are you searching for a motivated individual for your project?

Perhaps someone who has proven experience optimizing engineering workflows?

I'm an engineer-in-training and developer with a passion for learning and a drive to solve problems in the most robust and efficient manner. I love a challenge and love thinking about how to approach problems.

Please feel free to have a look through my projects and experience and get in touch if you feel I would be a good fit for your project.
